# README

Hello my name is Terry Cetoute and I am building my first ruby on rails app. Wanted to learn this coding language to help buffer my knowledge and to have more flexibility with app building and programming.

This is my Ruby on Rails Friends List App! The app is CRUD based to learn the basic and essential tools of building a Ruby Application.
